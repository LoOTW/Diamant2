Diamant2
========

I developed this tool in february 2016 for the ENAC, it was my first "big" project and I had at that time only
coded a few algorithms in Python.
Moreover I had limited time to do it an no knowledge of HCI. But it is completly functional and used since in two airdromes.

Installation
------------

For Windows, you have to determine wether your operating system work in
32 or 64 bits. You just have to type __wmic os get osarchitecture__

Then install the Anaconda corresponding to your OS.

Create at the root of your C: disk a folder named "Python34" and a "Scripts"
folder in this folder, and paste the [RTLF_DA-42.py](https://github.com/LoOTW/Diamant2/blob/master/RTLF_DA-42.py) file in this folder.


You can place the shortcut DIAMANT2.exe anywhere you want.
